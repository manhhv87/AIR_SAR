# AIR: Aerial Inspection RetinaNet for supporting Land Search and Rescue Missions

[![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/426364043.svg)](https://zenodo.org/badge/latestdoi/426364043) [![Docker Pulls](https://img.shields.io/docker/pulls/intrinsick/keras-retinanet-gpu?color=green)](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/intrinsick/keras-retinanet-gpu)

AIR is a deep learning based object detection solution to automate the aerial drone footage inspection task frequently carried out during search and rescue (SAR) operations with drone units. It provides a fast, convenient and reliable way to augment aerial, high-resolution image inspection for clues about human presence by highlighting relevant image regions with bounding boxes, as done in the image below. With the assistance of AIR, SAR missions with aerial drone searches can likely be carried out much faster before, and with considerably higher success rate.

This code repository is based on the [master's thesis work](http://urn.fi/URN:NBN:fi:aalto-202202061749) by **Pasi Pyrrö** <span itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/Person"><a itemprop="sameAs" content="https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0277-4996" href="https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0277-4996" target="orcid.widget" rel="me noopener noreferrer" style="vertical-align:top;"><img src="https://orcid.org/sites/default/files/images/orcid_16x16.png" style="width:1em;margin-right:.5em;" alt="ORCID iD icon"></a></span> from [Aalto University, School of Science](https://www.aalto.fi/en/school-of-science) which was funded by [Accenture](https://www.accenture.com/fi-en/about/company/finland).

## Key features
- Supports both video and images
- Highly accurate deep learning detector custom built for this application
- Decent processing speed despite the high-resolution images and a very deep neural network used
- Supports object tracking with kalman filter
- Implements the novel MOB bounding box postprocessing algorithm
- Implements the SAR-APD evaluation algorithm for real-world, value-oriented metric reporting in SAR aerial person detection applications
- Plethora of options for customization (e.g., in bounding box postprocessing, image preprocessing, speed vs accuracy trade-offs, etc.)

## Results on HERIDAL test set

In the table below are listed the results of the AIR detector and other notable state-of-the-art methods on the [HERIDAL](http://ipsar.fesb.unist.hr/HERIDAL%20database.html) test set. Note that the FPS metric is a rough estimate based on the reported inference speed and hardware setup by the original authors, and should be taken as mostly directional. We did not test any of the other methods ourselves.

| Method  | Precision  | Recall  | AP  | FPS  |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Mean shift segmentation method [[1](#references)]|  18.7 | 74.7 | - | -
|  Saliency guided VGG16 [[2](#references)] | 34.8 | 88.9 | - | - 
|  Faster R-CNN [[3](#references)] |  67.3 | 88.3 | **86.1** | **1** 
|  Two-stage multimodel CNN [[4](#references)] |  68.9 | **94.7** | - | 0.1 
|  SSD [[4](#references)] | 4.3 | 94.4 | - | -
|  AIR with NMS (ours) | **90.1** | 86.1 | 84.6 | **1**

It turns out AIR achieves state-of-the-art results in precison and inference speed while having comparable recall to the strongest competitors!

You can check out the full details of AIR evaluation in this [Wandb report](https://wandb.ai/hypersphere/masters-thesis/reports/Best-Model-Evaluation-Study--Vmlldzo1MDgxODE).

## Bounding Box Aggregation options

<img src="keras_retinanet/images/nms-vs-mob.png" alt="NMS-vs-MOB"/><br>

AIR implements both NMS and MOB algorithms for bounding box prediction postprocessing. The image above shows the main difference: MOB (c) merges bounding boxes (a) instead of eliminating them like NMS (b). Thus, choosing MOB can produce visually more pleasing predictions. Moreover, MOB is less sensitive to the choice of condifence score threshold, making it more robust under unseen data. AIR also comes with a custom SAR-APD evaluation scheme that truthfully ranks MOB-equipped object detector performance (as standard object detection metrics, such as VOC2012 AP, do not like MOB very much).

Should you choose MOB postprocessing and SAR-APD evaluation, you should see similar evaluation results (e.g., after running `bash evaluate.sh`)

All metrics increased by over 4 percentage points from NMS & VOC2012 results with no loss of prediction visual quality, neat!

## Quick demos

Once everything is set up (installation and asset downloads), you might wanna try out these cool and simple demos to get the hang of using the AIR detector.

### Running inference on HERIDAL test image folder
- In the project root, run the command: `/bin/bash infer.sh`
- Check `data/predictions/dauntless-sweep-2_resnet152_pascal-enclose-inference/` folder for the output images

### Evaluating AIR performance on HERIDAL test set (can be slow on CPU)
- In the project root, run the command: `/bin/bash evaluate.sh`
- Check `data/predictions/dauntless-sweep-2_resnet152_pascal-enclose-sar-apd-eval/` folder for the output images

### SAR-APD video detection with image output

## Wandb support
- AIR uses experiment tracking software by [Weight & Biases](https://wandb.ai/home)
- Wandb enables you to view [the whole public experimentation record for AIR](https://wandb.ai/hypersphere/masters-thesis/overview)
- AIR experiments can be controlled with the following environment variables:
    - `WANDB_MODE="disabled"`
        - disables all wandb functionality, required if not logged in to wandb
    - `WANDB_MODE="dryrun"`
        - wandb logging works as normal, but nothing is uploaded to cloud
    - `WANDB_API_KEY=<your_api_key>`
        - needed to interact with wandb web UI, you might want to put this in your ``~/.bashrc`` or ``~/.zshrc`` so that it's automatically included into the Docker envs. On most linux based systems, you can achieve this by running this shell command with your Wandb API key:
            ```bash
            echo "export WANDB_API_KEY=<your_api_key>" >> "~/.${SHELL/\/bin\//}rc"; exec $SHELL
            ```
    - `WANDB_DIR=~/wandb`
        - select where local log files are stored
    - `WANDB_PROJECT="air-testing"`
        - select your wandb cloud project
    - `WANDB_ENTITY="ML-Mike"`
        - select your wandb account username
    - `WANDB_RUN_GROUP="cool-experiments"`
        - Semantic group within a project to log experiments runs to
- More info in [wandb documentation](https://docs.wandb.ai/guides/track/advanced/environment-variables#optional-environment-variables) (not all env variables are supported though)
 
## Project folder structure

- **airutils:** air utility functions that augment the standard `keras-retinanet` framework to incorporate *aerial person detection* (APD) support to it.
- **config:**  configuration files for `video_detect.py` script (easier to use than the CLI in most cases)
- **data:** input and output data for the AIR detector, divided into subfolders:
    - `/datasets` (input for training and evaluation) 
    - `/images` (input for general inference)
    - `/predictions` (output of the AIR detector)
    - `/videos` (input for `video_detect.py`)
- **keras-retinanet:** a fork of the [keras-retinanet](https://github.com/fizyr/keras-retinanet) repository with some AIR modifications
- **models:** contains trained object detection models (both trainable and inference models)

## General toubleshooting
- Try setting the `AIR_VERBOSE=1` enviroment variable to see full TF logs
- If using docker, make sure you're allocating enough memory for the container (like at least 8 GB)
- If some script simply gets "killed", it's a clear indicator that you have too little memory allocated
- Tracker options in `video_detect.py` might need to be recalibrated for each use case for best performance
- If you edit any of the bash scripts in the root folder (e.g., `evaluate.sh`), make sure there are no whitespace after linebreaks '`\`', bash can be picky about these things... Also avoid commenting out any command line parameters in those scripts, just delete the whole line outright
- The actual python scripts corresponding to the bash scripts are in `keras_retinanet/keras_retinanet/bin` folder and they can be called directly (or you can try the installed console scripts (e.g., `air-evaluate`) if you ran `pip install .`) with approproate parameters (examples can be found in those bash scripts)
- Using the command line parameter `-h` or `--help` usually *helps* (pun intended)
- If you find a bug or have a complicated question, open a new issue here
